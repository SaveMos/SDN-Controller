# Tesi_ControllerSDN
This project was part of my final exam.
Application that through the REST API of Floodlight permits to handle the flow of packets in a virtual networks controller by a SND controller.
Particularly, it allows you to modify the flow of packets in the virtual network by forcing them to pass through certain nodes. The rest of the route will be calculated using the famous Dijkstra algorithm.
